    answer: "B",
    solution: String.raw`Oil enters the cylinder at
\[\frac43\text{ gal/hr}=\frac43(231)=308\text{ in}^3/\text{hr}.\]
The cylinder has radius 4, so \(V=16\pi h\). Hence
\[16\pi\frac{dh}{dt}=308,\qquad \frac{dh}{dt}=\frac{77}{4\pi}.\]
The stated one-gallon moment does not change this constant rate.`,

    answer: "B",
    solution: String.raw`Differentiate the series \(xe^{-x}=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}(-1)^nx^{n+1}/n!\):
\[(1-x)e^{-x}=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{(n+1)(-1)^nx^n}{n!}.\]
At \(x=1/2\), the full series equals \(1/(2\sqrt e)\). Removing its \(n=0\) term gives
\[\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{(n+1)(-1)^n}{n!2^n}=\frac1{2\sqrt e}-1.\]`,

    answer: "D",
    solution: String.raw`At height \(y\), the right and left sides of the triangular base are \(x=3-3y\) and \(x=2y-2\). Thus the width is \(5(1-y)\), and the rectangle's height is \(10(1-y)\). Its area is \(50(1-y)^2\), so

    choices: [String.raw`\(\frac{\sqrt2}{2}\)`, String.raw`\(-\frac{\sqrt2}{2}\)`, String.raw`\(\sqrt2\)`, "1", "NOTA"],
    answer: "C",
    solution: String.raw`Let \(t=\tan\theta\). The right triangles give
\[x=at,\qquad y=\frac bt,\qquad c=a\sqrt{1+t^2},\qquad d=\frac b{t}\sqrt{1+t^2}.\]
The angle condition along the upper segment gives \(at^2=b\), so \(t=\sqrt{b/a}\). Consequently
\[c=\sqrt{a(a+b)},\qquad d=\sqrt{b(a+b)}.\]
Therefore
\[\frac{a-b}{c-d}
=\frac{(\sqrt a-\sqrt b)(\sqrt a+\sqrt b)}{\sqrt{a+b}(\sqrt a-\sqrt b)}
=\frac{\sqrt a+\sqrt b}{\sqrt{a+b}}\longrightarrow\sqrt2.\]`,
